# Personal_portfolio_website
 I created a fully personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This website showcases my skills, projects, and provides a clean and interactive user experience. Through this task, Iâ€™ve improved my understanding of frontend development and design principles.<br>
 ðŸ–¥ The website features a design, making it accessible across all screen sizes.<br>
ðŸ’¡ Iâ€™ve added interactive elements using JavaScript, like a dynamic navigation bar and smooth user interface transitions, to enhance the user experience.<br>This project allowed me to strengthen my fundamentals in frontend development and understand how to structure a real-world portfolio that reflects my identity as a developer.
